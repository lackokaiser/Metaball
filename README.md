# Metaball

This was a university project for computer graphics with OpenGL.

If you are interested in finding out more about the simulated object, you can visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs).

## Extras

I have played around with the balls' mirror-like nature to have each ball reflect each other. The result was mind-blowing to me.

## Known issues

- The camera transformation is not correct; that is why the image looks a bit off.
- The ray marching algorithm is slow. It won't be noticeable in action, but this could have been improved.
